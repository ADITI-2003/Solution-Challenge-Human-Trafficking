      <p>Every home and school should teach children about safety and protection measures. As a parent, you should take an active interest in your children and listen to them. Teach your children that they can be assertive in order to protect themselves against abduction and exploitation. And most importantly, make your home a place of trust and support that fulfills your child's needs. Together we can protect our future generation by teaching them to be smart, strong, and safe.</p>
